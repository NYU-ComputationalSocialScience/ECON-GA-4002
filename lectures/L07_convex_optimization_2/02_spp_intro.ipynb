    "\n",
    "- The RTO: Manages overall activity and markets\n",
    "- Transmission line owners: Own the lines that are used to transmit power from one location to another\n",
    "- Power producers: Natural gas, wind, solar, coal, hydroelectric plants, and other energy plants that produce and add the energy to the grid\n",
    "- Power consumers: Large consumers like utility companies or factories\n",
    "- Financial traders: Market participants with no physical resources on grid (will explain more below...)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Households, retail locations, and other consumers of electricity do not typically interact with the RTO. They instead have a contract with a utility company that purchases electricity from the RTO's markets and routes this energy to households.\n",
    "\n",
