    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Student's t-distribution (or simply the t-distribution) is any member of a family of continuous probability distributions that arises when estimating the mean of a normally distributed population in situations where the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown. It was developed by William Sealy Gosset under the pseudonym Student.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we give a few examples of Student-t distribution (mainly t-test):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assessing the statistical significance of the difference between two sample means\n",
    "* linear regression analysis\n",
    "* the construction of confidence intervals for the difference between two population means\n",
    "* Bayesian analysis of data from a normal family\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Details\n",
    "\n",
    "The Student's t-distribution is a special case of the generalised hyperbolic distribution.One way to think about it is as like the Normal distribution with heavier tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Student-t distribution is symmetrically peaked, and its peak is located at $\\mu$, the location paramter. The peak’s width is dictated by scale parameter $\\sigma$, which is positive. Finally, the shape parameter, called “degrees of freedom,” is $\\nu$. This last parameter imparts the distribution with heavy tails for small $\\nu$.\n",

    "The probability mass function(probability density function) is given by\n",

    "f(y;\\nu, \\mu, \\sigma) = \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\nu+1}{2}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\nu}{2}\\right)\\sqrt{\\pi \\nu \\sigma^2}}\\left(1 + \\frac{(y-\\mu)^2}{\\nu \\sigma^2}\\right)^{-\\frac{\\nu + 1}{2}}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $v$ is the number of degrees of freedom and $\\Gamma$ is the gamma function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The probability density function of t-distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped, like the normal distribution, but has heavier tails, meaning that it is more prone to producing values that fall far from its mean. This makes it useful for understanding the statistical behavior of certain types of ratios of random quantities, in which variation in the denominator is amplified and may produce outlying values when the denominator of the ratio falls close to zero. As the number of degrees of freedom grows, the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma$. For this reason $\\nu$ is also known as the normality parameter.\n",
