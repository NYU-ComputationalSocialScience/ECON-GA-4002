    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In probability theory and statistics, the **Weibull distribution**, can be considered as a generalization of the exponential distribution. While exponential distribution describes the waiting time between continuously and independently event at a constant rate (events in a Poisson process), **Weibull distribution relaxes the constrain of constant rate by adding a shape parameter $k \\in (0, + \\infty)$ in exponential distribution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "It can also be applied to describe the *'waiting time'* of before something happens, just like a exponential distribution:  \n",
    "* the waiting time between two telephone call\n",
    "* the life of the electronic component (the waiting time before the breakdown)\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference is that the event like phone call or failure of an electronic component do not have to happen at constant rate as in exponential distribution. We will show that the waiting time decreases as time flies when $k \\in (0, 1)$, increases when $k \\in (1, + \\infty)$, and the distribution degenerates to the exponential distribution when $k = 1$.
